# ApiClientRest
A REST API client is usefull when you want to consume any REST API.

To call the REST API you need to call the EthosClientImpl class. It will return a JSON response back.

To get the expected value from raw JOSN response, one need to call ParseJSON class.

Thsi project is having one Main class ETHOSResponse.java, to show how to call the API client and parse the JSON.
